# You Got This, Bro!

## An interactive roguelite “game” about breaking bad habits in 90 days

### Game Concept:
 "You Got This, Bro!" is an interactive online and IRL roguelite game where players take on the role of a Bro on a mission to break a bad habit and live a healthier, happier life. The main objective is to abstain from the bad habit for at least 90 days. Each day in the game represents a level where the player fights urges and temptations to indulge in the habit. The player has only one life, and if they give in to the habit, they must start again from day 1.

### Key Features:
1. **Trials and Errors:** The game is challenging, emphasizing that breaking a bad habit is not easy and requires perseverance.
2. **Boss Fights and Milestones:** Boss fights occur on specific days (e.g., day 1, day 30), representing milestones in the player's journey to kick the habit.
3. **Progress and Streaks:** The player's progress and setbacks are saved and visualized as streaks, providing a clear picture of their successes and failures.
4. **Feel-Good Mechanics:** The game rewards players for completing longer streaks with achievements, leveling up, and other positive emotions.
5. **Peek Mechanic:** The "Peek" option allows the player to almost give in to the habit but ultimately overcome the urges without resetting their progress.
6. **Panic Button:** The panic button provides extra information about the bad habit, its benefits to quitting, and a chat feature for support and motivation from other players.
7. **Setback Input:** When a setback occurs, the player can input the reason for the setback, encouraging self-reflection and understanding.
8. **Honesty and Accountability:** The game relies on the player's honesty to mark each day as a win or a loss. The game doesn't enforce truthfulness, emphasizing that it's about personal growth and commitment.

### In-Game Aesthetics
To enhance the player's engagement and immersion, we should consider implementing:

1. **Custom Characters:** Allowing players to create and customize their Bro characters to feel a personal connection to the game.
2. **Motivational Visuals:** Designing visual elements that inspire players to keep going and remind them of the benefits of breaking the habit.

## Character Backstory: Brody "Bro" Thompson

### Background:
Brody Thompson, better known as "Bro," was once a confident and ambitious young man with a passion for filmmaking. Growing up in a close-knit family, he was always drawn to storytelling and visual arts. His dream was to become a renowned filmmaker, creating movies that touched people's hearts and minds.

### The Turning Point:
Bro's life took a dramatic turn when he faced a series of personal challenges. He started distancing himself from friends and family, feeling overwhelmed by the pressures of life and the competitive nature of the film industry. As he faced rejection and setbacks in his filmmaking endeavors, Bro's confidence began to crumble.

### The Struggle:
In his moments of vulnerability, Bro stumbled upon pornography as a temporary escape from his troubles. Initially, it seemed like a harmless distraction, but over time, it evolved into an addiction that hijacked his life. The more he indulged, the more it affected his creativity, focus, and relationships.

### A New Beginning:
One day, Bro looked in the mirror and didn't recognize the person staring back at him. He knew he had lost his way and felt a strong desire to break free from the grip of pornography. He realized that the addiction was hindering his dreams and robbing him of genuine connections with others.

However, he knew that succumbing to his addiction would only take him further away from his dreams. With each victory over the urge to indulge, he felt a newfound sense of self-worth and clarity.

### Finding Support:
In his quest to break free from pornography addiction, Bro found solace in a supportive community of individuals who were also fighting their battles. They shared their stories, offered advice, and held each other accountable, creating a sense of camaraderie that fueled Bro's determination.

### The Brody We See Today:
